TODO: rearrange navbar for Homepage, add the default one for collapse disappearing. 
	  Think about make the li group as part of util function, which makes life easier.
	  Decision to make: add <a>Project Name</a> for the navbar section on the very top. Only have the TravelLog stamp when collapse.
	  Talk about design with SA and SP.
